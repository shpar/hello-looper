# hello looper

*‘I’m quite bad at listening to long pieces – I’ve got a pretty shit attention span.‘ - Mica Levi*

A simple one beat looper with pause/play functionality, tempo and start time sliders and four hotkeys to save positions in the file. It also allows to sync the tempo and beat to the host DAW and to export the current beat as a wave file.
